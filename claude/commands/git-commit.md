# Commit the current changes

- Commit the current changes with an appropriate message
- Follow conventional commits format
- Dont look at the commit history, use the the current diff and your best judgement to come up with a message
- if it exists, use the context of the conversation to help derive the message
- if possible, commit message should state why the change was made not what the change is
